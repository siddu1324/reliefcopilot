IFRC Volunteer Management Essentials:
- Establish volunteer roles clearly: water-point attendants, hygiene promoters, queue marshals, translators.
- Provide simple guidance and just-in-time training for each role (1-2 min verbal or pictorial).
- Encourage volunteers to speak directly, use clear messages and gestures (helpful for low literacy contexts).
- Support volunteers with accessible tools (e.g., flashcards, pictograms, megaphones).
- Ensure volunteers understand inclusion: identify and assist persons with disabilities, children, elderly, and language minorities.
