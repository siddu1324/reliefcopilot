WHO Heatwave Public Advice:
- Encourage frequent small sips of water—even before feeling thirsty.
- Provide accessible shade, fans, or natural airflow; avoid closed and crowded environments.
- Monitor for dizziness, confusion, or fainting—move affected persons to cool areas and seek medical help if symptoms persist.
- Prioritize older adults and those with chronic conditions; ensure they have seats and shade.
- Avoid medical advice beyond hydration and rest—direct to trained health staff for any treatment.
