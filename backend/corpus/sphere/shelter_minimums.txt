Sphere Shelter Minimum Standards:
- Shelter must be dry, secure, ventilated, and allow for personal and gender privacy.
- Sleeping floor surfaces must stay dry and raised above ground; tarpaulins or plastic sheeting should provide waterproofing.
- Enforce adequate spacing between beds/cots—at least 1 m—for fire safety and privacy.
- Secure roof leakages immediately; use temporary covers (e.g., tarpaulin) to prevent water damage and mold.
- Check ventilation in enclosed spaces; openings should be present to ensure airflow without compromising safety or privacy.
