Sphere WASH minimums (excerpt, paraphrased):
- Safe water points with queue management lines (~1 m spacing).
- Handwashing at critical points: latrines, food areas, water collection.
- Chlorination guidance: ensure residual chlorine; avoid dosing instructions here.
- Clear signage; prioritize vulnerable groups in queues.
