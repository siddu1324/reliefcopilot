Sphere WASH Minimums (excerpt, paraphrased):
- Provide safe water points with physical distancing markers (~1 m spacing) to reduce crowding and contamination.
- Install handwashing stations at key locations—especially latrines and food/water collection areas—with soap or ash available.
- Ensure effective drainage to prevent standing water and muddy conditions around water points—this reduces vector breeding and slip hazards.
- Do not provide dosing advice; encourage caregivers to request assistance from trained personnel for health decisions.
- Maintain safe water quality by securing containers and avoiding direct contamination in communal supplies.
