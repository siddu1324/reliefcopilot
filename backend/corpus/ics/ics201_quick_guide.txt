ICS-201 Quick Guide:
- Summarize the situation: who is affected, where, and what’s the biggest risk (e.g., crowding, flooding, damage).
- Define top objectives—typically immediate life safety, access to basic services (water, shelter, hygiene), and support for vulnerable groups.
- Clarify roles: who manages operations, logistics, planning, and volunteers; assign a point person for communications.
- Identify resource gaps (e.g., water, lighting, medical aid) and immediate safety concerns (e.g., flooding, structural risks).
- Plan communications: verbal announcements (PA), SMS, volunteer coordination, and translations as needed.
