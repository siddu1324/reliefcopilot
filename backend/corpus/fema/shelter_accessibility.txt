FEMA Shelter Accessibility Checklist (summary):
- Ensure accessible routes connect shelter entrance to parking, toilets, water pointsâ€”no steps, with ramps if needed.
- Pathways must be at least 150 cm wide to accommodate wheelchairs side-by-side.
- Ensure at least 10 % of latrines and water points are accessible (signage and located within 50 m of shelters).
- Provide artificial lighting in circulation areas to enhance safety and access.
